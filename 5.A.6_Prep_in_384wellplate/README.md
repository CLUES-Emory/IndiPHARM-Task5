This folder contains materials that can be used to replicate an automated sample preparation protocol which prepares biofluids such as plasma, serum, urine, and follicular fluids for liquid chromatrography - high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis using the Opentrons Flex automated liquid handler. These  protocols are written to extract and prepare 4 separate 96-tube matrix racks for HILIC and reversed-phase (C18) LC assays using a single 384-well plate for each assay.

Inside this folder lives: 
- A written SOP for how to replicate this protocol, including a list of softare, equipment, labware, safety procedures, and instructions for setup and execution of the protcol. (251201_Automated_Sample_Prep_SOP-LC_Flex-3sample_plates_1QAQC.docx)
- 2 .py files which are the actual Opentrons protocols you will need to upload into the Opentrons app to run. Once uploaded, the user can view the deck configuration and follow along in the written protocol.
- Labware definitions necessary to run the protcols in the Opentrons app (you will need to import them in the Labware Definitions tab of the app).
