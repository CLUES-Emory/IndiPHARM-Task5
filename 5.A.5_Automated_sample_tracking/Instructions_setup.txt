1. Create your study folder. Inside the main study folder, add a QAQCs and Samples workbook with Matrix IDs and Sample IDs. These will be used for tracking and generating a sequence for LC analysis. Make sure to match the column names to the example.
2. Inside the sequence generator app folder, open RUN.R and edit lines 13-23 (most important - paths to your Samples and QAQC sheets.)
3. Scan your study racks and QAQC rack using the Microic plate scanner. Ensure the settings create an output like the example in this folder.
3. In RStudio, open Run.R if not already open. Ensure all paths are correct. Click 'Run App'
4. Upload your plate scans in the order they will be aliquoted in the Opentrons protocol. 
5. Follow the remaining instructions in the protocol for the sequence generator to output C18 and HILIC sequence lists.
