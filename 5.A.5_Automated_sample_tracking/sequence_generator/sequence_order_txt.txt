Conditions:
-	2 sample racks, each with >60 samples
 	o	FULL QAQC
-	2 sample racks, second rack < 60 samples
 	o	1 less pool (5 instead of 6)
-	1 sample rack only:
 	o	3 less pool (3 instead of 6)
 	o	1 less PFAS baby cal curve (only need 2 of each calibration point instead of 3)
 	o	1 less PFAS QAQC (only need 2 of 3)
