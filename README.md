## indiPHARM Task 5 --- CLUES Protocols and Automation ---
This repository, prepared by the Walker Lab at Emory University's Gangarosa Department of Environmental Health, contains materials that can be used to replicate an automated sample preparation protocol which prepares biofluids such as plasma, serum, urine, and follicular fluids for liquid chromatrography - high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis using the Opentrons Flex automated liquid handler. 

Folder 5.A.2 contains .py protocols and a written SOP for a 96-well plate method to prepare samples for LC analysis.
Folder 5.A.5 contains a written SOP and an R-shiny application which transform plate scans from a Micronic plate scanner to an LC-ready sequence list following the CLUES study design.
Folder 5.A.6 contains .py protocols and a written SOP for a 384-well plate method to prepare samples for LC analysis.

These protocols are intended to be reproducible in labs with the required instrumentation and equipment. Extraction of biosamples are optimized for HILIC and reversed-phase (C18) LC assays using a single 384-well plate for each assay.
